                    1. Soligorsk waste heaps
                    Soligorsk waste heaps
                    Someone compares these species with Mars, someone with the desert. 
                    There are almost real mountains under Soligorsk. In fact, it is the waste of the extraction of potash fertilizers "Belaruskali" — clay with salt and gypsum, sand. 
                    But, thanks to the height of almost 120 meters, it seems that in front of you is a small mountain range. The water around the landfills is a concentrated brine, 
                    which is why many compare it with the water of the Dead Sea. 
                    Of course, it cannot be considered curative. And the landfills themselves cannot be called completely safe: 
                    they are located on the territory of technical facilities and are not adapted for mass visits by people.

                    Kozyansk marshes
                    From the Martian landscapes – to the craters of Mercury. 
                    Such associations are caused by the marshes in the Kozyansky Nature Reserve in the Vitebsk region. 
                    In their western part, the Poozersky glacier has created something unimaginable, leaving more than 400 small lakes on an area of 5 square kilometers. 
                    Kozyany is a certain visual antipode of the more hyped Yelnya, which you will also see a little below. 
                    But if the main Yelnya picture can be considered islands with pine trees among the water surface, then here, on the contrary, there are strips of land among hundreds of lakes. 
                    However, there is no paved trail with flooring in the Kozinsky Nature Reserve, 
                    which means that either an experienced guide or careful preparation and caution are needed. But daredevils will certainly see space!

                    3. The only cave in Belarus
                    Sakhnovichi is the only cave in Belarus
                    Location: Vitebsk region, Glubokiy district, near the village of Sakhnovichi;
                    The karst cave with a depth of 10 meters was formed 25 thousand years ago after the Lake glaciation. 
                    It is washed in sandstone, so the strong-minded who climb there have a persistent feeling that the walls are about to crumble. 
                    The cave entrance is quite narrow, but 3 people can fit inside. It will not be possible to walk under the arches, however, for the residents of Belarus it is an interesting speleolog

                    Having a moderately continental climate, northern Belarus is characterized by moderately cold winters with blizzards and snowfalls, but in its southern part, even in winter, the temperature is near zero. It is warm in summer, but rarely hot – on average the temperature stays just above 20 °C.
                    The humidity level is elevated due to the influence of Atlantic air masses, and precipitation is distributed fairly evenly across the seasons, although summer and autumn are more rainy. In general, the climate corresponds to the Russian one, adjusted for softness, but there are no exceptional features that can surprise a Russian.

                    Minsk is one of the oldest cities in Europe. The first written mention of the future capital of the Republic of Belarus dates back to 1067. At that time, the united grandsons of Rogneda, the sons of Yaroslav the Wise - the Kiev princes Izyaslav, Svyatoslav and Vsevolod Yaroslavich - with an army appeared near the city of Menesk in retaliation for the campaign of the Polotsk Prince Vseslav Bryachislavich to Pskov in 1065. They captured the fortress city of Menesk and defeated Vseslav's troops in the memorable battle of Nemiga, described in the "Word about Igor's Regiment".

                    A millennium later, the city was destined to become one of the most famous peacekeeping centers of the planet of the XXI century. And being ruined to the ground more than once and being reborn, Minsk knows the price of peace and tranquility like no other city. It is the only city in Belarus that was awarded the title of "Hero City" in 1974 in commemoration of the merits of its residents in the fight against fascism during the Great Patriotic War.

                    One of the official languages of our country is the Belarusian language. It is rich in nature and there are even several variants of it.
                    In the old days, the Proto-Slavic folk dialect language was used on the territory of Belarus. 
                    In the 6th century it was transformed into Old Russian, and in the 11th century – into Old Slavonic. 
                    Historians claim that the formation of the Belarusian language as an independent unit began in the 14th century. 
                    It is based on the dialects of several tribes: ancient Radimichi, Dregovich, Smolensk and Polotsk Krivichi. 
                    The Belarusian language was also influenced by Northerners, Yatvyags, Prussians and other Balts.

                    Most of the 82 species of mammals in Belarus are inhabitants of taiga and broad-leaved forests. In these natural areas, animals are well provided with food and shelter. Rodents predominate in fields and meadows. Reptiles and amphibians are most often found in swampy areas. There are about 328 species of birds on the territory of Belarus. About a quarter of the species are migratory, and the rest lead a sedentary or nomadic lifestyle.

                    here are many reservoirs in Belarus. The rivers form a huge network with a total length of 90 thousand km. The most common species of ichthyofauna are minnow, bullhead, perch, pike and crucian carp. There are valuable fish species: burbot, trout and walleye. Some animals are of great economic importance. Wild boar, roe deer, elk, fox and wolf are objects of hunting.
